It is very useful to use on a dataset that is distributed multinomially. This algorithm is especially preferred in classification tasks based on natural language processing. Spam detection is one of the applications where this algorithm can be used. If you have never used this algorithm for the machine learning problems based on classification before, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through an introduction to the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm in machine learning and its implementation using Python.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Multinomial Naive Bayes\n\nMultinomial Naive Bayes is one of the variations of the Naive Bayes algorithm in machine learning which is very useful to use on a dataset that is distributed multinomially.
